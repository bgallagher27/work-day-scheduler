# work-day-scheduler

This helpful scheduler app functions as a digital day planner to help organize your busy day. Each field is interactive and will hold your scheduled activity by the hour. Once you input your daily activites to an hourly field, click the button to save your activities. The planner will save your scheduled acitvities, so if you have to leave and come back, your schedule will still remain.

## color coded

The scheduler is also color-coded to help keep track of your day. Each hourly field will change colors based on the time of day:

--The hour will show green if it is upcoming later in the day

--The hour will show red if it is currently in that hour

--The hour will show gray if that hour has already passed today
